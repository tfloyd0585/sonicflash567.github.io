<p>For those who might not know this, two of my favorite video game franchises that I grew up playing are Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon</p>
<p>These games are both 2D and 3D platformers that started on the Playstation and began the success of platforming games</p>
<p>For more information on both games, feel free to check out the following pages:</p>
